Introduction to Github

I am avid tech enthusiast trying to dive deeper into programming. Writing code is challenging, fun, and life affirming; navigating through different versions of a script is not. My hope is that Github will enable me to be more proficient in writing code while facilitating organization and collaboration. 

I love Python for it's simplicity and versatility, but I really want to dive into C for it's raw speed and power. I work with EEGs so I will apply my knowledge to write apps that involve Digital Signal Processing. Cheers to a good start in the foundations!
